# Bachelor Thesis for B.Sc ATLAS at University of Twente
# Optimal Control of Tilt-Multirotor using Learned Dynamics

This project looks into using a 1-layer ReLU Neural Network as the oracle in Learning Based Model Predictive Control for a tilt-quadrotor UAV.

Experiments are run using simulation_experiments.mlx

Disturbances are modeled in the folder Disturbances
Neural nets are defined and trained in the folder learning_modules
Simulation Models are defined in the folder plants
Controller models are defined in the folder models


To run the experiments, download/ clone the repository and run the simulation_experiments.mlx notebook.
